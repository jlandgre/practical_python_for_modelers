This repository is a training workshop to teach modelers how to use Python at a practical level. It assumes students have basic knowledge of the Python language and Pandas open-source library including knowing how to run code in a Jupyter notebook. It delves into how to organize files and folders within a project. It covers how code architecture influences personal and collaborative productivity in using Python and teaches skills for moving beyond working exclusively in Jupyter notebooks. As such, it gives an intro to using Object-Oriented Programming with Test Driven Development in combination as a working style for building modular simulation models and data transformation pipelines.

The training targets a corporate R&D, Modeling and Simulation or business modeler audience --possibly engineers and scientists but no specific background assumed. See Practical Python for Modeling.docx for a detailed outline.
